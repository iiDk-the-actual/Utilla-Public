CHEATING IS PROHIBITED BY THE DEVELOPERS OF GORILLA TAG, AND GOES AGAINST THE GORILLA TAG INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

https://gorillatagvr.com/gorillatagvr-mod-policy

CHEATING INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO:
- USING MODS OUTSIDE OF MODDED ROOMS THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO MODIFY GAMEPLAY IN THE ROOM
- HAVING A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON GAMEPLAY WITH EXPLOITS IN ANY ROOM

YOU CAN GET BANNED BY CHEATING FROM BEING REPORTED OR HAVING THE ANTI-CHEAT DETECT YOU:
- YOU CAN BE REPORTED ANYWHERE (INCLUDING MODDED ROOMS) AND POTENTIALLY GET A BAN FROM A PATTERN OF REPORTS
- THE ANTI-CHEAT CAN TAKE ACTION AGAINST YOU INSTANTLY, AS LONG AS ATTEMPTED CHEATING IS DETECTED BY THE SYSTEM

TO AVOID A BAN, STOP ANY FORM OF CHEATING, AND MOD SAFELY:
- USE TRUSTED SOURCES LIKE THE GORILLA TAG MODDING DISCORD
- KNOW WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR WHEN IT COMES TO AVOIDING CHEATS

IF A MOD ORIGINATES FROM A CHEAT COMMUNITY OR HAS OPTIONS LABELED AS "DETECTED", THAT IS A CHEAT, REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU USE IT.
