CHECKERS HAVE BECOME AN ISSUE IN THE GORILLA TAG MODDING COMMUNITY, TO THE POINT OF BEING AGAINST THE RULES IN COMMUNITIES LIKE THE GORILLA TAG MODDING SERVER ON DISCORD.

A CHECKER ACTS AS LOGIC THAT CAN RETRIEVE UNSOLICITED INFORMATION FROM PLAYERS, SO WITHOUT PERMISSION OF THE PLAYER.

CHECKERS ARE USUALLY INCLUDED AS THE SOLE INCLUSION IN THEIR OWN MODS, ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE APPEARED IN UTILITY AND NAME-TAG MODS.

MOD CHECKERS IN PARTICULAR (CHECKERS THAT GET THE MODS PEOPLE USE) HAVE CAUSED MUCH GRIEF IN THE PAST WITH PEOPLE USING THEM TO REPORT OTHERS, HASSLE OTHERS AND IN SOME CASES BULLY PLAYERS ALL BECAUSE OF THE MODS THEY HAVE INSTALLED. BECAUSE OF THIS, THEY ARE FREQUENTLY PROHIBITED FROM USAGE AND SEEN AS A REPORTABLE OFFENSE TO MANY PLAYERS.

OTHER CHECKERS THAT HAVE CAUSED ISSUES INCLUDE COSMETIC CHECKERS (CHECKERS THAT GET THE COSMETICS PEOPLE OWN) AND PLATFORM CHECKERS (CHECKERS THAT IDENTIFY WHICH PLATFORM THE PLAYER IS ON.)

PLEASE REFRAIN FROM USING THESE CHECKERS, AS THEY CAN BE USED TO HARASS PLAYERS AND OBTAIN THEIR INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE KEPT TO THEMSELVES OR WHEN THEY WANT TO MAKE IT KNOWN.
